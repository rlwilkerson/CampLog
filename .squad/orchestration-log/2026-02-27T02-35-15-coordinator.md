# Orchestration Log: Coordinator — Logout 400 Fix

**Agent:** Coordinator  
**Date:** 2026-02-27T02:35:15Z  
**Status:** ✓ Complete

## Task
Fixed logout 400 Bad Request error in CampLog.Web Profile page.

## Execution
1. Modified Profile.cshtml.cs: Added OnPost() with SignOut(Cookie + OIDC)
2. Modified Profile.cshtml: Removed cross-page action and antiforgery token declaration (auto-injected by Razor Pages)
3. Added required namespaces (Authentication, Cookies, OpenIdConnect)
4. Validated: dotnet build (0 errors)
5. Restarted web resource and verified functionality

## Outcome
Logout now works without 400 error. Form posts to Profile page itself, ensuring antiforgery token consistency.

## Files Changed
- CampLog.Web/Pages/Account/Profile.cshtml.cs
- CampLog.Web/Pages/Account/Profile.cshtml
