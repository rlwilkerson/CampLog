# Leia — Web Project Restart (Orchestration Log)

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-28T05:09:29Z  
**Agent:** Leia (Frontend)  
**Request:** Restart frontend/web-project implementation stream

## Outcome

✅ **COMPLETE** — Created `CampLog.Web2` as a safe parallel clone of modernized UI stack.

## Actions Taken

1. **Cloned CampLog.Web → CampLog.Web2**
   - Source: Current production-facing Razor Pages + HTMX + Pico CSS stack
   - Destination: `C:\code\rlwilkerson\CampLog\main\CampLog.Web2`
   - Rationale: Safe parallel workspace; preserves current behavior; enables divergence for future Wedge specs

2. **Updated CampLog.slnx**
   - Added `CampLog.Web2/CampLog.Web2.csproj` to solution manifest
   - All project references intact
   - Build validation passed

3. **Logged Decision**
   - File: `.squad/decisions/inbox/leia-web-project-restart.md`
   - Decision: Restart web project creation with safe parallel clone

4. **Documented Skill**
   - File: `.squad/skills/web-project-bootstrap-copy/SKILL.md`
   - Reusable skill: cloning and integrating new web projects into Aspire solution manifests

## Blockers & Constraints

- **No Web2-specific Playwright specs yet:** Awaiting Wedge's test specifications before diverging UI behavior in Web2
- **Current Web preserved:** CampLog.Web remains unchanged; Web2 is independent workspace

## Team Impact

- Frontend (Leia): Has dedicated Web2 workspace for future design/feature work
- QA (Wedge): Test specifications still pending; Web2 adoption awaits test-driven requirements
- DevOps (Chewie): No infrastructure changes required at this stage

## Files Produced

- `CampLog.Web2/**` — complete cloned project
- `CampLog.slnx` — updated solution manifest
- `.squad/decisions/inbox/leia-web-project-restart.md` — decision log
- `.squad/skills/web-project-bootstrap-copy/SKILL.md` — reusable skill

**Status:** Ready for next phase (Wedge test specs → Leia UI implementation)
