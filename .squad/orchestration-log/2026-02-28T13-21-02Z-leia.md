# Leia — Web2 Mockup Approval Variations (Orchestration Log)

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-28T13:21:02Z  
**Agent:** Leia (Frontend)  
**Mode:** Background  
**Request:** Web2 should be a different layout with same colors/functions; create at least 2 mockup variations before feature implementation

## Outcome

✅ **COMPLETE** — Two non-implementation Web2 mockup variations created with comparison landing page. All changes approved-only (no backend/service behavior changes).

## Actions Taken

### 1. Created Mockup Index Landing Page
- **File:** `CampLog.Web2/Pages/Mockups/Index.cshtml`
- **Purpose:** Side-by-side comparison entry point for stakeholder approval
- **Content:** Brief description of both variations with links to try each layout

### 2. Created Variation A: Heritage Header + Content Bands
- **File:** `CampLog.Web2/Pages/Mockups/VariationA.cshtml`
- **Pattern:** Traditional horizontal navigation header with full-width content bands
- **Features:**
  - Horizontal top app bar with logo, search, and auth controls
  - Full-width section bands with background color separation
  - HTMX targets wired to slide-out panel for create/edit flows
  - Preserves all Dusty Summer colors and Pico CSS baseline
- **Approval Checkpoint:** Layout structure only; no state/routing changes

### 3. Created Variation B: Ledger Header + Command Drawer  
- **File:** `CampLog.Web2/Pages/Mockups/VariationB.cshtml`
- **Pattern:** Compact ledger-style header with slide-out action drawer
- **Features:**
  - Minimal horizontal header (logo + auth in corner)
  - Narrow command/filter drawer from side (alternative to fixed tab bar)
  - Content area with ledger-grid visual (accounts/items list with sparse action menu)
  - HTMX targets wired to slide-out panel for create/edit flows
  - Preserves all Dusty Summer colors and Pico CSS baseline
- **Approval Checkpoint:** Layout structure only; no state/routing changes

### 4. Enhanced CSS Support
- **File:** `CampLog.Web2/wwwroot/css/camplog.css`
- **Additions:** Mockup-specific utility classes (`.mockup-header-nav`, `.mockup-bands`, `.mockup-drawer`, `.mockup-ledger`) for layout exploration
- **Note:** No changes to existing core Dusty Summer color tokens; all extensions compatible with modernized frontend

### 5. Documented Decision
- **File:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/leia-web2-mockups.md`
- **Decision:** Create two approval-only Razor mockup directions before implementation work begins
- **Rationale:** Gives owner clear side-by-side direction choices without shipping features

## Blockers & Constraints

- **Approval Gate:** Both variations remain unapproved mockups until stakeholder review complete
- **No Backend Changes:** Mock pages do not affect API, Keycloak, or service layer
- **HTMX Readiness:** All mockup pages preserve existing HTMX target patterns to enable seamless feature transition after approval

## Team Impact

- **Owner (Rick):** Two distinct layout directions ready for review and selection
- **QA (Wedge):** Mockup pages are approval-only; no test coverage required until feature implementation
- **DevOps (Chewie):** No AppHost changes; Web2 resource unchanged
- **Backend (Luke):** No API impact; mockups are purely frontend layout exploration

## Files Produced

- `CampLog.Web2/Pages/Mockups/Index.cshtml` — Comparison landing page
- `CampLog.Web2/Pages/Mockups/VariationA.cshtml` — Heritage Header pattern
- `CampLog.Web2/Pages/Mockups/VariationB.cshtml` — Ledger Header pattern
- `CampLog.Web2/wwwroot/css/camplog.css` — Enhanced with mockup utility classes
- `.squad/decisions/inbox/leia-web2-mockups.md` — Decision proposal

## Validation

✅ `dotnet build CampLog.slnx` passes — No breaking changes  
✅ Web2 project maintains AppHost compatibility  
✅ All Dusty Summer colors preserved in new CSS utilities  
✅ HTMX targets and slide-out panel patterns ready for post-approval implementation

**Status:** Ready for stakeholder approval → Next phase: Implement selected variation based on feedback
