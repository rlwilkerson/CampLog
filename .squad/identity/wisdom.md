# Team Wisdom

Reusable patterns and heuristics learned through work. NOT transcripts — each entry is a distilled, actionable insight.

## Patterns

<!-- Append entries below. Format: **Pattern:** description. **Context:** when it applies. -->
**Pattern:** Add computed-style Playwright assertions for typography, spacing, touch target size, and tokenized colors when enforcing visual redesign acceptance criteria. **Context:** frontend refreshes where behavior and style quality must be validated before implementation is complete.
**Pattern:** Use semantic micro-structure upgrades (`aria-current`, count chips, key/value meta rows) plus CSS token refinements to deliver a visible modernization without changing routes, handlers, or HTMX request targets. **Context:** visual refresh work where UX quality must improve but behavior must remain stable.

## Anti-Patterns

<!-- Things we tried that didn't work. **Avoid:** description. **Why:** reason. -->
